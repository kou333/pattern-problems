You are given two long numbers N1 and N2 in a string. You need to find out if the product of these numbers generate an even number or an odd number, If it is an even number print 1 else print 0.

Example 1:

Input: 
N1 = "12"
N2 = "15"
Output: 1
Explanation: 12 * 15 = 180 which is an 
even number.
â€‹Example 2:

Input: 
N1 = "123"
N2 = "457"
Output: 0
Explanation: 123*457 = 56211 which is an 
odd number.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function EvenOdd() which accepts two strings N1 and N2 as input parameter and returns 1 or 0 accordingly.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 ≤ N1, N2 ≤ 1099



coding solution       







class Sol {
    int EvenOdd(String n1, String n2) {
        // Get the last digit of both numbers as characters
        char lastDigit1 = n1.charAt(n1.length() - 1);
        char lastDigit2 = n2.charAt(n2.length() - 1);

        // Check if either last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
        if (isEven(lastDigit1) || isEven(lastDigit2)) {
            return 1; // Return 1 for even
        } else {
            return 0; // Return 0 for odd
        }
    }

    // Helper method to check if a character representing a digit is even
    private boolean isEven(char digit) {
        return digit == '0' || digit == '2' || digit == '4' || digit == '6' || digit == '8';
    }
}
